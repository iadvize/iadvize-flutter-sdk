# Flutter Messenger SDK Plugin support

iAdvize Messenger SDK support comes in several distinct status:

- **Full support**: the SDK will receive bug-fixes and new features on a regular basis. MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH versions can be released upon it.
- **Partial support**: the SDK will receive security bug-fixes. Upon this version, only PATCH releases will be made, no MAJOR or MINOR. Update to the latest SDK is advized.
- **No support**: this SDK version is not supported anymore, update to the latest SDK is mandatory and unstable behaviours may occur during the use.

The iAdvize Flutter Messenger SDK Plugin support is dependent on the support of the native SDK (Android, iOS) it embeds.
